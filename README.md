## CSCI 2312: Programming Assignment 4

_inheritance, polymorphism, board games, randomization_

* * *

### Goals

1. Create a simple board game with various types of pieces which move and interact in a two-dimensional grid.
2. Learn to work with class hierarchies, including abstract and concrete classes, to define complex behavior.
3. Learn to work with `virtual` functions and overriding to extend and specialize behavior while supporting polymorphism.
4. Learn to implement and use a _functor_ to specify object behavior.
5. Learn to use the `<random>` library to randomize object behavior.
6. Learn to implement a `virtual` binary operator to implement object interaction.
7. Implement of a fully functional C++ program in one go.
8. Continue using git and Github.
9. Develop good coding style.
