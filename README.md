## CSCI 2312: Programming Assignment 4

_inheritance, polymorphism, board games, randomization_

* * *

### Goals

1. Get experience with inheritance, polymorphism, and class hierarchies in the domain of board turn-based strategic games.
2. Enrich your pallette of C++ tools to define complex behavior:
  1. Abstract and concrete classes for hierarchical behavior extension.
  2. `virtual` functions and overriding to specialize behavior while supporting polymorphism.
  3. _functors_ to specify dynamic object behavior.
  4. The `<random>` library to randomize object behavior.
  5. A `virtual` binary operator to implement object interaction.
  6. STL classes for data management.
3. Develop in _one go_ a small-scale semi-interactive game with bare-bones ASCII visualization.
4. Continue using git and Github.
5. Develop good coding style.
